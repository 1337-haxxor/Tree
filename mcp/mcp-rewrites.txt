# Paper MCP renames
#
# We use some different MCP names for our dev environment because the MCP names
# sometimes clash with the CraftBukkit added variable names. We use spigot names
# after the reobf task, so these names can be changed to whatever we want -
# they only affect the dev environment.

# The format of this file is simple:
# <srg_name>,<new_name>
# And for reference, the old mcp name is appended to the end of the line after a comment (#)
# Though that isn't required
